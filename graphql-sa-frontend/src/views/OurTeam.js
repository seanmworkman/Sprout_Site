  "Ryan Olk": `I look forward to contributing to an atmosphere of collegiality and mutual respect that rewards outstanding teaching and fosters active intellectual and creative engagement. I am always drawn to empowering others through mathematical competency.
  Responsible for overseeing all the research and development of analytical, statistical, and programming tools and algorithms to collect, analyze, and interpret large data sets to develop data-driven solutions to difficult business challenges.
  Additionally, I routinely conduct meetings with customers for discerning what data was to be collected and to what end. For example, worked with a law firm to determine which facets of their accounting department was best at predicting a future line of credit of up to a million dollars.`,
